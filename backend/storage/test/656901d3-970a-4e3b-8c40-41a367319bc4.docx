-   **Trip Optimizer** focuses heavily on fuel and emissions
    optimization through dynamic throttle/braking control, automation,
    and real-time integration with multiple control systems working
    primarily in the **CLASS I** space deployed on **12,000**
    locomotives.

    -   **Need to interview CLASS I customers to get reliable feedback**

    -   **Need to know pricing (structure and rate)**

    -   **Need to find gaps in their offering -- i.e. ability to handle
        various Tier trains, need for integration with locomotive and
        other systems (i.e. PTC) or not, price, dissatisfied customers
        (with the incumbent and "only" current market offering)**

        -   **Can these gaps be attacked to create a winning Shortline
            segment product -- can they eventually be leveraged to win
            share in the CLASS I market**

-   **RailVision**, by contrast, is focused on the **Shortline** segment
    with a locomotive-agonistic technology. Need to develop a
    **legitimate available market**.

    -   **Need to develop true market size -- First thought: Develop and
        actionable game plan targeting 15,000 Tier 0 (if accurate)
        locomotives -- something easy to understand like 10,000 vehicles
        (assuming the count that is working everyday) times \$300/month
        license fee times 12 months = ARR of \$36M market. Develop the
        market in three phases: Shortline (with current and full
        execution expectations) then CLASS I then GLOBAL.**

    -   **Need to deeply assess shortline customers' appetite for the
        product -- what is their perceived ROI -- what are their
        alternatives -- what is their assessment and to-date real
        experience with RailVision -- will they buy if we get it
        right???**

Potential technology roadmap decisions -- **NEED TO DEVELOP based on the
above**

1.  **Review railvision.ca** to critically analyze its efficacy in
    fuel-saving/eco-driving modules (e.g. optimize throttle, braking,
    and horsepower management).

2.  **Integrate with control systems** (e.g. PTC, distributed power,
    LOCOTROL) to move farther into automation territory.

3.  **Bundle existing AI-vision** strengths with new efficiency modules
    --- enabling a combined safety + eco-optimization system.

4.  **And more....**

Wabtec doesn't publicly list a per-unit price for Trip Optimizer in
filings or press materials---most of their public data focuses on its
deployment scale and aggregate benefits. However, we can draw reasonable
estimates based on some figures in their filings.

**Web research**

-   **Recent large order**\
    In Wabtec's Q4 earnings report, they mention:

"Wabtec has taken orders worth \$74 million for upgrading Trip Optimizer
and Locotrol on locomotives in North America."
[wabteccorp.com+11wabteccorp.com+11wabteccorp.com+11](https://www.wabteccorp.com/TripOptimizer-brochure.pdf?inline=&utm_source=chatgpt.com)[youtube.com+11freightwaves.com+11wabteccorp.com+11](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/wabtecs-earnings-and-outlook-disappoint-wall-street?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   **Installed base**\
    As of January 2024, Trip Optimizer had been installed on ≈12,000
    locomotives globally, including \"all North American Class I
    railroads\"
    [masstransitmag.com+5wabteccorp.com+5railwayage.com+5](https://www.wabteccorp.com/newsroom/press-releases/wabtec-s-trip-optimizer-surpasses-1-billion-miles-significantly-reducing-the-rail-industry-s-fuel-consumption-and?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**ChatGPT analysis (suspect to inaccuracy for sure)**

While the \$74 M package is a bundled upgrade alongside Locotrol, we can
apportion it roughly for Trip Optimizer cost estimation.

Assume:

-   This \$74 M covers, say, **2,000 locomotives**---a plausible size
    for a batch modernization across Class I fleets.

-   The package is split evenly between Locotrol and Trip Optimizer.\
    That would assign **\$37 M for Trip Optimizer** across those units.

-   Therefore, **per-locomotive costs** are in the range of:

    -   **\$37 M ÷ 2,000 = \$18,500**

    -   If evenly split across 2,000 units and half the budget.

Depending on actual allocation and unit counts, a **cost range of
\$15,000 to \$30,000 per locomotive** seems plausible. This price would
generally include:

-   Trip Optimizer hardware (GoLINC/TMC interface or PTC energy
    management card)

-   Software license and integration

-   Track database / surveying services

-   Initial supervised runs and deployment support

**More ChatGPT**

There's no single definitive public per-locomotive price due to bundling
and proprietary pricing. But given:

1.  \$74 M for upgrades of both Trip Optimizer & Locotrol
    [wabteccorp.com+1wabteccorp.com+1](https://www.wabteccorp.com/TripOptimizer-brochure.pdf?inline=&utm_source=chatgpt.com),

2.  The total installed base,

3.  Typical batch sizes of upgrades,

we can estimate that Trip Optimizer costs **approximately
\$15,000--\$30,000 per locomotive** for Class I railroads when rolled
out as part of upgrade/swaps

**What the SEC Filings Reveal**

-   Wabtec reports its energy management offerings---including Trip
    Optimizer, SmartHPT, and LOCOTROL---as part of consolidated sales,
    without per-unit or product-level pricing [Wabtec
    Corporation+3Wabtec Corporation+3Wabtec
    Corporation+3](https://www.wabteccorp.com/trains-of-thought/on-the-right-track-how-wabtec-s-trip-optimizer-is-transforming-freight-train-efficiency?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

-   Total "remaining performance obligations" (i.e., signed contracts
    yet to be recognized as revenue) stand at approximately \$22 billion
    as of late 2021
    [SEC](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/943452/000162828022002997/wab-20211231.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
    Given Trip Optimizer's presence across Class I fleets, a meaningful
    chunk of this backlog likely supports its continued deployment and
    upgrades.

**📉 Refined Price‑Per‑Locomotive Estimate**

Build on our earlier logic:

1.  **Analogous Batches:**

    -   A recent deal quoted at \$74 million for Trip Optimizer +
        LOCOTROL upgrades on a batch of North American locomotives.

    -   If that applies to \~2,000 units and costs are split evenly
        between the two systems, Trip Optimizer's share is
        \~\$37 million.

2.  **Per‑Unit Cost Range:**

    -   That translates to roughly **\$18,500 per locomotive** just for
        Trip Optimizer.

    -   If contract size or system split vary, a broader **range of
        \$15,000 to \$30,000 per diesel locomotive** remains plausible.

3.  **Complementary Services & Upgrades:**

    -   This includes hardware (PTC/energy management cards), software
        license, database creation/updates, installation, crew training,
        and deployment support.

**📊 Summary & Confidence**

-   ❌ **No explicit unit price revealed in SEC filings.**

-   ✅ Public statements like the \$74 M bundle give us real-world
    anchoring.

-   ✅ Back-of-the-envelope math suggests **\$15K--\$30K per
    locomotive** for Trip Optimizer, most often in bundled upgrade
    contexts.

-   ⚠️ Final pricing can vary based on fleet size, contract structure,
    roll-out scope, and included services.

**✅ Next Steps You Could Take**

If you aim for greater precision:

-   Analyze **quarterly earnings call transcripts**, where management
    may discuss system adoption rates.

-   Compare year-over-year **segment revenue growth** in digital systems
    vs. installed base to infer ASP (average selling price).

-   Review filings for **recent contract awards or backlog detail**,
    which sometimes include system-level commentary.

Let me know if you'd like me to deep-dive into earnings transcripts or
segment revenue trends for more precision.

**Segment Trends & Digital Intelligence Update**

-   In Q4 2024, Wabtec's **digital intelligence** sales---which include
    Trip Optimizer and other onboard systems---were **down 1.4% YoY**,
    weighed by North American softness but offset by international
    demand
    [ir.wabteccorp.com+12Investing.com+12ir.wabteccorp.com+12](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-westinghouse-air-brake-q4-2024-misses-eps-93CH-3865070?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

-   Conversely, Q3 2024 saw **digital intelligence growth of \~12.7%
    YoY** , signaling variability driven by timing of deployments.

-   Freight segment backlog remains strong---Q4 2024 freight backlog
    hitting **\$5.58 B** (12-month) and **\$18 B** (multi-year)
    [Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-westinghouse-air-brake-q4-2024-misses-eps-93CH-3865070?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

**🗣️ Earnings Call Insights**

While there's no explicit Trip Optimizer pricing discussed, remarks from
Q4 2024 earnings include:

Analysts inquired about the company\'s pricing strategy and margin
expansion opportunities. Executives emphasized their focus on value
delivery and highlighted growth potential in international markets,
particularly in digital intelligence
[ir.wabteccorp.com+6Investing.com+6ir.wabteccorp.com+6](https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-westinghouse-air-brake-q4-2024-misses-eps-93CH-3865070?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

This suggests the company views digital intelligence
products---including Trip Optimizer---as margin-enhancing tools and is
actively considering pricing dynamics, but no per-unit figures were
disclosed.

**💰 Pricing Inference: Refined**

Bringing together all clues:

1.  **Batch upgrade order:** \~\$74 M for combined Trip Optimizer +
    LOCOTROL [Wabtec
    Corporation](https://www.wabteccorp.com/digital-intelligence/energy-management/trip-optimizer-smarthpt?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

2.  **Deployment volatility:** Digital intelligence growth fluctuates
    quarterly, aligning with discrete batch orders .

3.  **Backlog size:** Multi-billion-dollar backlog provides capacity for
    further deployments .

Result:

-   Conservative estimate: **\$15K--\$30K per locomotive**, consistent
    with our earlier range.

-   Price variability expected depending on order size, fleet
    modernization scope, included services, and mix of systems bundled.

**✅ Summary**

-   **No explicit per-unit pricing** appears in transcripts or filings.

-   **Digital intelligence category fluctuations** confirm
    deployment-driven revenue cycles.

-   Combined with the \$74 M order, passenger per‑unit estimates remain
    **\$15K--\$30K per locomotive** for Trip Optimizer

1.  **Wabtec's press materials** emphasize Trip Optimizer deployments
    mainly with **Class I railroads** and major global operators
    (Brazil, Australia, etc.), with 12,000+ locomotives in service
    [wabteccorp.com+15ir.wabteccorp.com+15railwayage.com+15](https://ir.wabteccorp.com/news-releases/news-release-details/wabtecs-trip-optimizertm-surpasses-1-billion-miles-significantly?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

2.  The **Short Line Railroad Transportation Management System (TMS)**,
    referenced in Wabtec\'s SEC disclosure, is distinct:

"Transportation Management System: Manages movement of \>9 M annual
carloads; used by 520 Short Lines..."\
This highlights digital tools targeted at short lines---but does *not*
include Trip Optimizer.

3.  No announcements or press releases specifically mention Trip
    Optimizer being deployed or sold to shortline/regional railroads.

**✅ Bottom Line**

-   **Trip Optimizer** has been proudly marketed and sold primarily to
    **Class I railroads** and larger operators.

-   There's **no indication** of adoption by shortline or regional lines
    in any public source.

-   In contrast, Wabtec clearly differentiates its **Transportation
    Management System** for shortline use---which is a completely
    separate product line.

LB Foster

**What LB Foster & First Analytics bring to the table**

-   **L.B. Foster (Rail Technologies)** --- a large, established
    supplier of rail track products and technology with a long-running
    *friction management* practice (top-of-rail lubricants/modifiers,
    wayside applicators, measurement and monitoring). Their materials
    and services explicitly list *improved fuel economy* and
    "performance validation / long-term benefit validation" as outcomes
    of friction management programs. [L.B.
    Foster+1](https://lbfoster.com/rail?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

-   **First Analytics** --- a boutique analytics & AI consultancy that
    helps companies design measurement systems and validate outcomes
    with advanced statistical methods. Rob (Robert/Rob) Stevens is a
    senior leader there and is co-author on an analytical white paper
    specifically about validating railroad fuel-saving technologies ---
    that paper is directly relevant to the conference talk you cited.
    [First
    Analytics+1](https://firstanalytics.com/staff-member/rob-stevens/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Together, this is the common stack you'll see in practice: LB Foster
provides a field intervention (lubricants, applicators, friction
management program and instrumentation), and First Analytics provides
the statistical/AI validation to prove the intervention produced real
fuel savings beyond normal variability.

**How fuel-savings validation is usually done (methods you should
adopt)**

The literature and the First Analytics paper use a combination of these
robust techniques --- all are applicable to shortlines:

1.  **Define clear KPIs up front**

    -   Primary examples: fuel gallons per gross ton-mile (GTM per
        gallon inverted), fuel gallons per train-mile, or fuel per
        ton-mile for a given commodity/consist. Also record idle time,
        throttle notch distribution, train mass, speed profile, and
        tonnage per train. (If you track GTM, you can compute fuel per
        GTM which normalizes for size and distance.)

2.  **Baseline and control design**

    -   Use a pre-intervention baseline period and, where possible, a
        control group (other locomotives, other subdivisions, or matched
        train types that do not receive the treatment). When controls
        aren't available, use longer historical baselines and
        time-series adjustments.

3.  **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**

    -   Classic approach when you have treated vs. untreated groups over
        the same time window. DiD estimates the change in fuel use for
        treated units relative to controls, adjusting for shared time
        effects.

4.  **Regression modeling with covariates**

    -   Regress fuel consumption (or log fuel) on predictors: train
        weight (tons), train length, average speed, grade profile,
        ambient temperature, consist, engineer/crew,
        day-of-week/seasonal terms, and a treatment indicator. This
        isolates the treatment effect controlling for confounders.

5.  **Propensity score matching (PSM)**

    -   Useful if treated vs. untreated routes/trains differ. Match
        similar runs on pre-treatment features, then compare fuel
        outcomes.

6.  **Time-series / interrupted time series (ITS)**

    -   If you implement treatment system-wide and lack controls, ITS
        with autoregressive errors can detect level or slope changes
        after treatment, accounting for autocorrelation.

7.  **Bootstrapping & uncertainty quantification**

    -   Always report confidence intervals (or Bayesian posterior
        intervals) for the estimated % fuel savings, not just point
        estimates.

8.  **Outlier handling & robustness checks**

    -   Remove or analyze separately extreme events (weather, outages,
        clogged fuel filters) and run sensitivity checks (different
        baseline windows, lag structures).

(These methods and recommendations align with the analytical guidance in

**Practical data & instrumentation for shortlines**

Shortlines tend to have resource constraints, so focus on the most
cost-effective data collection:

-   **Essential data** (minimum): fuel gallons by locomotive (fuel
    receipts / fuel meters), train movement logs (departure/arrival
    times, mileposts), tonnage per train (cars × load), distance,
    locomotive hours/engine hours, and consist information.

-   **High-value add**: event recorder (VDR) / onboard telemetry
    (throttle profile, speed), GPS tracking for accurate time/distance,
    fuel flow meters on locomotives (if feasible), and wayside sensors
    (axle counters, wayside weigh-in-motion) for GTM accuracy.

-   **Operational metadata**: crew/engineer, weather, maintenance
    events, idling events, and any changes in timetables or routing.

**Recommended step-by-step pilot plan for RailVision.ca (shortline
focus)**

1.  **Select 2--3 pilot corridors** with different operating
    characteristics (flat vs hilly, heavy vs light traffic).

2.  **Establish baseline**: collect at least 3--6 months of
    pre-treatment data; longer if seasonal effects are present.

3.  **Choose treatment(s)**: e.g., top-of-rail friction modifier,
    wheel/lubricant, or operational advisory (driver advisory, throttle
    guidance). LB Foster friction management is one such proven physical
    treatment; also consider operational AI/telemetry recommendations.

4.  **Instrumentation rollout**: ensure synchronized timestamps across
    fuel and movement logs; install fuel meters or reconcile fuel
    purchase records to locomotive assignments.

5.  **Statistical plan (pre-registered)**: publish a short plan
    describing KPIs, baseline period, control selection, models to be
    used (DiD + regression), outlier criteria, and significance
    thresholds. This prevents ex-post fishing. (First Analytics'
    materials stress formal analytical approaches and preplanning.)

6.  **Run pilot (3--6 months)**, collect data continuously.

7.  **Analyze with multiple methods** (DiD, regression, ITS) and report
    point estimates + CIs, sensitivity checks, and operational
    explanations for observed changes (e.g., reduced resistance or
    changed throttle behavior).

8.  **Translate to business case**: convert % fuel saved into \$ saved
    (fuel price scenarios) and compute payback for friction management
    equipment and monitoring costs.

9.  **Scale with an iterative loop**: refine placement, dosing rates, or
    AI models and repeat validation for new corridors.

**Things to watch out for / pitfalls**

-   **Confounding operational changes** (new schedules, locomotive
    swaps, crew changes) can mimic savings --- you must control for
    them.

-   **Small sample sizes / high variance**: shortlines with few trains
    require longer time windows or pooled analysis across multiple
    shortlines to reach statistical power. Use bootstrapping and report
    uncertainty.

-   **Measurement error** in fuel allocation (pooled fueling across
    locomotives) --- consider fleet allocation rules or fuel meters.

-   **Seasonality & weather**: cold weather increases fuel use; always
    adjust or include weather as a covariate.

**Quick recommended resources & contacts**

-   Use LB Foster friction management product pages and their
    "performance validation" docs for technical claims and case studies.

-   Use the First Analytics white paper *Analytical Approaches to
    Validating Railroad Fuel Saving Technology* (the
    conference/committee paper) as your statistical-methods template.

**Short, actionable next steps for you (1--3)**

1.  **Inventory what data RailVision.ca already has** (fuel receipts,
    train movement logs, GTM or gross ton & distance) --- I can help you
    make a checklist or data schema.

2.  **Pick a pilot shortline & timeframe** (I recommend at least 6
    months baseline + 3--6 months post). If you give me the data fields
    you can access, I'll draft a crisp statistical plan (models,
    covariates, required sample size heuristics).

3.  **If you want, I can draft the pre-registered analysis plan & sample
    code** (R or Python) you'd need to run DiD, regression, matching and
    ITS analyses and produce the business-case numbers.

Would you like me to (A) draft a one-page pre-registered statistical
plan tailored to a shortline pilot, or (B) build a checklist of the
exact data fields and their formats RailVision.ca should collect? Pick
one and I'll generate it right away.
